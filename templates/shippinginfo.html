<h4>2. The Pickup Process </h4>
<p>To ensure efficiency and minimal disruption, all orders must be collected at a pre-booked time slot.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>2.1. Order Readiness Notification</h4>
<ol>
    <li>After you successfully complete the mock checkout process, your order will be placed in our production queue.</li>
    <li>You will receive an Order Confirmation Email immediately.</li>
    <li>Once your stickers have been printed and packaged (usually within [e.g., 2-3 school days]), you will receive a second email—the "Ready for Pickup" Notification. This email confirms your order is complete and contains a link to the scheduling tool.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h4>2.2. Scheduling Your Pickup Time</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Click the link in your "Ready for Pickup" Notification email.</li>
    <li>Select an available 10-minute time slot that works best for you. Available slots are typically between [e.g., 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM] and [e.g., 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM] on school days.</li>
    <li>You will receive a final confirmation with the exact time and location details.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h4>2.3. Pickup Location</h4>
<p>Your pickup location is centralized for easy access:</p>
<table style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <tr>
        <th>Location Detail</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Building</td>
        <td>R10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Floor</td>
        <td>1st Floor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Specific Spot</td>
        <td>Near ISSD</td>
    </tr>


</table>
<hr>
    <h4>3. Important Notes for Collection</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Proof of Order: When collecting your stickers, you MUST be prepared to show either your Order Confirmation Email or your Pickup Time Slot Confirmation (printed or on your phone) to the staff member/student volunteer.</li>
        <li>Identification: Please have your ID card or student card ready for verification.</li>
        <li>Missed Slots: If you miss your scheduled time slot, you must re-schedule your pickup via the link provided in your "Ready for Pickup" notification email. We cannot guarantee same-day collection outside of the pre-booked slots.</li>
        <li>Maximum Hold Time: Orders must be collected within [e.g., 14 school days] of receiving the "Ready for Pickup" notification. Orders not collected after this time will be considered abandoned and the stickers may be redistributed.</li>
    </ul>
